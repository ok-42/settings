# Settings


## Installation

Clone the project and execute the installation script. It makes a copy of your original `.bashrc` and `.gitconfig` 
files that will be replaced with the local ones. You can find them in `~/old_files` (if necessary, set another name).

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ok-42/settings.git
cd settings/
bash setup.sh
```


## Usage

Create an empty project and virtual environment:

```bash
new project_name
```
